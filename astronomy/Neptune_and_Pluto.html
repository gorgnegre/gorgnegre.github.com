<a name="1"></a>The first planet to be discovered was Uranus by William and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel_Caroline.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Herschel_Caroline',550,800); return false;">Caroline Herschel</a>
on 13 March 1781. It was discovered by the fact that it showed a disk
when viewed through even a fairly low powered telescope. The only other
planets which have been discovered are Neptune and Pluto. These were
predicted using ingenious mathematical arguments based on <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s laws of gravitation and then observed near their predicted locations.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="3"></a>In fact Neptune could have been discovered without the mathematical arguments. It very nearly was discovered by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a>, the first person who could possibly have discovered a new planet. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a>
turned his telescope on the planets and was immediately fascinated by
the system of Jupiter and its moons which he observed. While he was
observing the Jupiter system on 28 December 1612 he recorded Neptune as
an 8<sup>th</sup> magnitude star. Just over a month later on 27 January
1613, he recorded two stars in his field of view. One was Neptune and
the other a genuine star. Remarkably, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a>
observed the pair again the following night when he noted that the two
stars appeared to be further apart. How close he was at that point to
discovering that one of the stars was the planet Neptune. See [<a href="javascript:ref('S%20Drake%20and%20C%20T%20Kowal,%20Galileo\'s%20sighting%20of%20Neptune,%20<i>Scientific%20American</i>%20<b>243</b>%20(6)%20(1980)%2052-59.',1)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">1</a>].<br>

</p><p align="justify">
<a name="5"></a>Neptune was to be recorded several more times, without being recognised as a planet, over the following years. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Lalande.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lalande',550,800); return false;">Lalande</a> (1732-1807), a French astronomer whose tables of the planetary positions were the most accurate until the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, recorded Neptune on the 8<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> of May 1795 without recognising that it was not a star. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Herschel',550,800); return false;">John Herschel</a>,
who we shall see in a moment was to be involved with the discovery of
Neptune, recorded Neptune on 14 July 1830 believing it to be a star.
</p><p align="justify">Von Lamont (1805-1879), a Scottish born
astronomer who lived most of his life in Munich, is famed for his
determination of the orbits of moons of Saturn and Uranus, and also for
discovering the periodic fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field. He
recorded Neptune on at least three occasions, namely on 25 October
1845, 7 September 1846 and 11 September 1846. As a highly skilled
observer, one might have expected that von Lamont would have recognised
the motion of Neptune over the four day period. However he failed to do
so, only days before Neptune was discovered.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="9"></a>The discovery of Neptune however did not come from any
of these chance observations. Rather it came from a mathematical
analysis of the deviation of Uranus from its predicted orbit. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Delambre.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Delambre',550,800); return false;">Delambre</a> computed tables of planetary positions <i>Tables du Soleil, de Jupiter, de Saturne, d'Uranus et des satellites de Jupiter</i>
published in 1792. However discrepancies began to arise in the
predicted position of Uranus. Bouvard (1767-1843), a French astronomer
who was director of the Paris Observatory, had already published
accurate tables of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn in 1808 and he now
undertook to produce a corrected version of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Delambre.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Delambre',550,800); return false;">Delambre</a>'s
tables for Uranus. However he could not make all the observations fit,
even after taking the perturbations of the other planets into account.
He published his new tables of Uranus in 1821 but wrote
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>... I leave it to the future the task of discovering whether the
difficulty of reconciling [the data] is connected with the ancient
observations, or whether it depends on some foreign and unperceived
cause which may have been acting upon the planet.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="13"></a>Although Bouvard had used the latest data to determine
the orbit of Uranus, it soon became apparent that it was deviating from
the position given in his tables. On 3 July 1841 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>, while still an undergraduate at Cambridge, wrote
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>Formed a design in the beginning of this week, of investigating, as
soon as possible after taking my degree, the irregularities of the
motion of Uranus, which are yet unaccounted for; in order to find out
whether they may be attributed to the action of an undiscovered planet
beyond it; and if possible thence to determine the elements of its
orbit, etc.. approximately, which would probably lead to its discovery.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="17"></a>Not everyone however attributed the problems of Uranus's orbit to an unknown planet beyond it. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a>,
the Astronomer Royal, believed in another popular theory, namely that
the inverse square law of gravitation began to break down over large
distances. However after <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>
had made an initial investigation of the effect that an undiscovered
planet might have on Uranus, he was greatly encouraged in his belief
that he was on the right track, and he obtained from <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> the Greenwich data on Uranus in February 1844. 
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="19"></a>In June 1845 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Arago.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Arago',550,800); return false;">Arago</a>, the director of the Paris observatory, persuaded <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> to start work on the problem of Uranus's orbit. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> quickly decided to devote himself fully to the problem and set aside the work he had been doing on comets. Neither <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> nor <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> knew that the other was working on the problem.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="21"></a>By September 1845 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>
had made a more detailed study of the problem and deduced an orbit for
the perturbing planet. As well as the orbit he had calculated the mass
of the planet and its position on 1 October 1845. He sent has
predictions to James Challis, the director of the Cambridge
Observatory.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="23"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> was breaking new mathematical ground here. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s
theory of gravitation had been used many times to calculate the effects
of bodies on one another but never had it been used to predict the
position of a body from observations of the effects of its gravity on
other bodies. Nevertheless <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> was very confident in his theory and referred to the "new planet". An attempt by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> to give <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> information on the "new planet" failed when <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> visited Greenwich on 23 September on his way between his home in Laneast, Cornwall and Cambridge since <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> was in France at the time. 
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="25"></a>On 21 October 1845 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> made a second attempt to visit <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> on his way to Cambridge. He was told that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> was in London but would be back soon. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> returned in the afternoon but <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> was at dinner. In fact <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> had the rather unusual habit of eating dinner at 3.30 every afternoon so <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> was turned away. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>
left a manuscript with his research on the orbit of Uranus in which he
showed that, given the orbit which he proposed for the new planet, the
errors in Uranus's position were extremely small.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="27"></a>In fact <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> was clearly interested in <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>' work for, on 5 November, he wrote to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>
asking what appeared to be a somewhat technical question. He wanted to
know whether the postulated "new planet" explained not only the
discrepancies in the longitude of Uranus but also the discrepancies in
its radius vector. This question was designed to try to distinguish
between the "new planet" theory and the "failure of the inverse square
law" theory. However <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>, already cross at what he saw was <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a>'s refusal to see him, made no answer. He decided to search for the new planet himself:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>I could not expect, however, that practical astronomers, who were
already fully occupied with important labours, would feel as much
confidence in the results of my investigation, as I myself did; and I
therefore had our instruments put in order, with the express purpose,
if no one else took up the subject, of undertaking the search for the
planet myself, with the small means afforded by our observatory at St
John's.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="31"></a>On 10 November <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>
published his first paper on his investigations. In it he showed that
the perturbations on the orbit of Uranus due to Jupiter and Saturn
could not explain the observations. On 1 June 1846 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>
published a second paper in which he showed that a variety of other
possible causes could not explain the orbit of Uranus, and deduced that
the only possible cause could be a planet further from the Sun than
Uranus. He gave some details of a possible orbit of the "new planet"
with a predicted position for the beginning of 1847. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> approached the Paris Observatory to search for the planet but after a very brief search they lost interest.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="33"></a>On 23 June the results of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>'s paper reached <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> who immediately saw that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>'s prediction and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> prediction for the position of the "new planet" were almost identical. Three days later he wrote to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> asking the same question about the radius vector as he had asked <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>. Strangely <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a>, who now knew that both <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> had come to almost identical solutions to the same problem, did not tell either of them about the other, nor did he tell <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> of his plans to begin a search. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a> replied to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a>'s questions convincing him that the deviations were indeed due to a "new planet". On 29 June <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> met with Challis and John <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Herschel',550,800); return false;">Herschel</a> in Greenwich and told them of
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>...the extreme probability of now discovering a new planet in a very
short time, provided the powers of one observatory could be directed to
search for it.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="37"></a>On 9 July <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> asked Challis to begin a search at the Cambridge Observatory. He was somewhat reluctant: as he later wrote:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>It was so novel a thing to undertake observations in reliance upon
merely theoretical deductions; and that while much labour was certain,
success appeared very doubtful.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="41"></a>Despite his reservations, Challis began the search on 29 July 1846, recording stars in the area of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>'s
prediction. He observed on the nights of 29, 30 July, 4, 12 August and
recorded the results. He checked out his methods by comparing the first
39 stars recorded on 12 August and checking that they appeared on his
30 July records. If he had continued his comparison he would have
discovered the "new planet" which he had recorded on 12 August but
which had not been in the search area on 30 July. He had also recorded
the planet on 4 August but he never compared these records.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="43"></a>Later in August <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Herschel',550,800); return false;">John Herschel</a>
visited an amateur astronomer William Dawes and told him of the "new
planet" but, since Dawes had only a small telescope, he thought it not
worth searching.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="45"></a>On 31 August <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>
published his third paper on the "new planet". This time he gave full
details of the predicted orbit and the mass. He also deduced the
angular diameter and wrote:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>It should be possible to see the new planet in good telescopes and
also to distinguish it by the size of its disk. This is a very
important point .... if a simple study of its physical appearance can
replace the rigorous determination of the positions of all the stars,
the search will proceed much more rapidly.</i>

<a name="49"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> wrote to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a>
on 2 September giving a more through analysis of the problem. His first
solution had depended on assuming a distance for the "new planet" of
twice that of Uranus from the Sun. He was unhappy with this arbitrary
part of his solution and he had redone the mathematical analysis
finding a better estimate of the distance of the "new planet" by
testing different distances against the observed perturbations of
Uranus.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="51"></a>Dawes, although thinking (wrongly) that he could not
observe the "new planet", suddenly had a thought. His friend William
Lassell, another anateur astronomer and a brewer by trade, had just
completed building a large telescope that would be able to record the
disk of the planet. He wrote to Lassell giving him <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>'s
predicted position. However Lassell had sprained his ankle and was
confined to bed. He read the letter which he gave to his maid who then
promptly lost it. His ankle was sufficiently recovered on the next
night and he looked in vain for the letter with the predicted position.
His chance of fame had gone!

<a name="53"></a>On 10 September <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Herschel',550,800); return false;">John Herschel</a> addressed a meeting of the British Association in Southampton. He spoke of the "new planet" saying:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>We see it as Columbus saw America from the shores of Spain. Its
movements have been felt, trembling along the far-reaching line of our
analysis, with a certainty hardly inferior to that of ocular
demonstration.</i>

<a name="57"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Herschel',550,800); return false;">Herschel</a> was a very fine mathematician and clearly had a faith in the mathematical analysis which many astronomers failed to have. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>
intended to present a paper on his researches at the Southampton
meeting. However Section A of the British Association ended its session
one day before he expected and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> arrived in Southampton too late to announce his predictions.

wrote to the German astronomer Galle on 18 September asking him to
search for the "new planet" at his predicted location. Galle received
the letter on 23 September and together with his assistant Heinrich
d'Arrest began a search that night at the Royal Observatory in Berlin.
D'Arrest suggested they use the latest star chart which had only just
been produced. It took them less than 30 minutes to locate a star not
on their map. Of course they knew that they had found the "new planet"
but they confirmed it the following night by observing it had moved
relative to the stars.<br>

<a name="69"></a>On 29 September <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>'s
paper of 31 August reached Challis. He observed that night, searching
the predicted position for the disk of the planet. He noted that only
one from 300 stars in the region appeared to show a disk. Of course he
had observed the planet but, a cautious man by nature, he waited until
he could confirm the result by showing the motion of the planet. He did
not observe again before 1 October when <i>The Times</i> carried the announcement of Galle's discovery with the headline <i>Le Verrier's Planet Found.</i>
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="71"></a>As soon as he read the headline, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Herschel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Herschel',550,800); return false;">Herschel</a> wrote to Lassell saying

Lassell began observing on 2 October and on 10 October he discovered Neptune's moon Triton.

Challis and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> each reported on the story of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a>'s predictions and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> himself published his memoir <i>An
explanation of the observed irregularities in the motion of Uranus, on
the hypothesis of disturbances caused by a more distant planet; with a
determination of the mass, orbit, and position of the disturbing body.</i>
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="79"></a>Once the orbit of Neptune was worked out sufficiently
well, older records were searched to see if it had been recorded
earlier. When Lalande's observations of Neptune on the 8<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>
of May 1795 were discovered it was noted that Lalande had rejected the
8 May position and recorded a star in the 10 May position of Neptune,
but marked it as doubtful. He never bothered to make a further
observation to confirm the data which would have certainly resulted in
his discovery of Neptune. When <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Airy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Airy',550,800); return false;">Airy</a> learnt of this he wrote to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> saying
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>Let no one after this blame Challis.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="83"></a>Once the orbit of Neptune was computed it was seen that both <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>
had been quite lucky with their predictions. Both had predicted
positions which were very close to the actual position but both had
predicted orbits which meant that Neptune would only be close to its
predicted position around 1840-1850 while at other times (it takes
about 165 years to complete one orbit and has not yet completed one
since its discovery) it would be far from the positions predicted by
both <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Adams.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Adams',550,800); return false;">Adams</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>.<br>
<br>
Here is <a href="javascript:win1('../Extras/Adams_Leverrier',850,600)" target="_blank">a cartoon about the discovery of Neptune</a>
</p><p align="justify">
The solar system did not, however, behave as expected. Neptune did not
follow the orbit computed, even after taking the gravitational
attraction of all the other known planets into account. To a lesser
extent neither did Uranus and Saturn. Percival Lowell (1855-1916), an
American astronomer, was interested in Mars. He built a private
observatory at Flagstaff, Arizona specifically to study the planet. He
began a mathematical analysis of the orbit of Uranus which was known
more accurately than that of Neptune and yet failed to follow its
predicted path. In 1905 Lowell completed his analysis of the data and
predicted the existence of a planet beyond Neptune which was
responsible for the perturbations. </p><p align="justify">
By 1905, of course, astronomical observations had greatly improved due
to photography. A search was begun at the Flagstaff Observatory in 1915
and for two years they photographed the area of the sky in which
"Planet X", as Lowell called it, was predicted. Nothing was found.
Lowell redid his mathematical analysis and, between 1914 and 1916, he
again photographed the area of the sky where his predictions showed
that Planet X would lie. In fact there are images of Pluto (Lowell's
Planet X) on these plates but they are faint and were not recognised.
</p><p align="justify">
Lowell presented has paper <i>Memoir on a Trans-Neptunian Planet</i> to the American Academy on 13 January 1915. He wrote to his chief observer at Flagstaff:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>I am giving my work before the Academy on January </i>13<i>. It would be thoughtful of you to announce discovery at the same time.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
No discovery was made however and, as Lowell's brother later wrote:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>That X was not found was the sharpest disappointment of his life.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">Another American astronomer,
William Henry Pickering (1858-1938), actually constructed Lowell's
Flagstaff Observatory in 1894. He moved to the Harvard College
Observatory and, in 1919, he also predicted a position of a
trans-Neptunian planet using the discrepancies in both the orbits of
Uranus and Neptune as data. A search of photographs taken at the Mount
Wilson Observatory failed to find the planet at the position predicted
by Pickering.
</p><p align="justify">In January 1929 Clyde W Tombaugh (1906- )
joined the staff at Flagstaff, with the task of finding Planet X. He
used a new technique, namely comparing two plates taken some time apart
by "blinking", that is shining a light successively through one plate
and then the other so that objects on both plates remained steady while
an object on one plate but not the other blinked. Tombaugh wrote:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>... on the afternoon of February </i>18, 1930<i>, I suddenly came
upon the images of Pluto! The experience was an intense thrill, because
the nature of the object was apparent at first sight.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
The planet was photographed every night from then on to confirm the observation and on 13 March 1930, the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Lowell's birth and the 149<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of Uranus's discovery (it is a remarkable coincidence that
these should be the same day), an announcement was made from Flagstaff.
In May 1930 the Flagstaff Observatory proposed the name Pluto for
Planet X. They proposed a symbol consisting of interlocking letters P
and L. It is interesting after the arguments about the naming of
Neptune, that they managed to work Percival Lowell's initials into the
planet name in such a major way.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="105"></a>This looked like another fantastic piece of mathematical theory by Lowell. However <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Brown.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Brown',550,800); return false;">Brown</a>
reviewed the data which Lowell had used and showed that there was no
way that he could have made the correct prediction based on the data.
Russell, a leading American astronomer, wrote:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="107"></a><i>The question arises ... why is there an actual
planet moving in an orbit which is so uncannily like the one
predicted?... There seems no escape from the conclusion that this is a
matter of chance. That so close a set of chance coincidences should
occur is almost incredible, but the evidence employed by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Brown.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Brown',550,800); return false;">Brown</a> permits of no other conclusion...</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
The mass of Pluto is now known accurately since a satellite Charon has
been discovered. Pluto's mass is 0.002 Earth masses, while Lowell
required Planet X to have seven Earth masses to produce the effects on
the other planets. The mystery remains as to how Lowell was able to
predict the orbit so accurately and the mystery also remains as to why
the outer planets fail to keep to their correct orbits.<br>
