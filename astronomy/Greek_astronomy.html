<a name="s1"></a>Today the study of astronomy requires a deep
understanding of mathematics and physics. It is important to realise
that Greek astronomy (we are interested in the topic during the 1000
years between 700 BC and 300 AD) did not involve physics. Indeed, as
Pannekoek points out in [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20%20A%20Pannekoek,%20<i>A%20history%20of%20astronomy</i>%20%20(New%20York,%201989).',7)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">7</a>],
a Greek astronomer aimed only to describe the heavens while a Greek
physicist sought out physical truth. Mathematics provided the means of
description, so astronomy during the 1000 years that interest us in
this article was one of the branches of mathematics. </p><p align="justify">
<a name="s3"></a>The Greeks began to think of philosophy from the time of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Thales.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Thales',550,800); return false;">Thales</a> in about 600 BC. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Thales.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Thales',550,800); return false;">Thales</a>
himself, although famed for his prediction of an eclipse, probably had
little knowledge of astronomy, yet he brought back from Egypt knowledge
of mathematics into the Greek world and possibly also some knowledge of
Babylonian astronomy. It is reasonable to begin by looking at what
'astronomy' was in Greece around this time. However we begin by looking
further back than this to around 700 BC.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s5"></a>Basically at this time astronomy was all to do with
time keeping. It is natural that astronomical events such as the day
would make a natural period of time and likewise the periodic phases of
the moon make the next natural time span. Indeed these provided the
basic methods of time keeping around the period of 700 BC yet, of
course, another important period of time, the year, was not easy to
determine in terms of months. Yet a knowledge of the approximate length
of the year was vital for food production and so schemes had to be
devised. Farmers at this time would base their planting strategies on
the rising and setting of the constellations, that is the times when
certain constellations would first become visible before sunrise or
were last visible after sunset.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s7"></a>Hesiad, one of the earliest Greek poets, often called
the "father of Greek didactic poetry" wrote around 700 BC. Two of his
complete epics have survived, the one relevant to us here is <i>Works and Days</i>  describing peasant life. In this work Hesiad writes that (see [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20%20B%20Hetherington,%20<i>A%20chronicle%20of%20pre-telescope%20astronomy</i>%20%20(Chichester,%201996).',5)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">5</a>], also [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20%20A%20F%20Aveni,%20<i>Empires%20of%20time%20:%20Calendars,%20clocks%20and%20cultures</i>%20%20(New%20York,%201989).',1)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">1</a>] and [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20%20A%20Pannekoek,%20<i>A%20history%20of%20astronomy</i>%20%20(New%20York,%201989).',7)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">7</a>]):-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s9"></a><i>... when the Pleiades rise it is time to use the sickle, but the plough when they are setting; </i>40<i>
days they stay away from heaven; when Arcturus ascends from the sea
and, rising in the evening, remain visible for the entire night, the
grapes must be pruned; but when Orion and Sirius come in the middle of
heaven and the rosy fingered Eos sees Arcturus, the grapes must be
picked; when the Pleiades, the Hyades, and Orion are setting, then mind
the plough; when the Pleiades, fleeing Orion, plunge into the dark sea,
storms may be expected; </i>50<i> days after the sun's turning is the
right time for man to navigate; when Orion appears, Demeter's gift has
to be brought to the well-smoothed threshing floor.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s11"></a>For many hundreds of years astronomers would write
works on such rising and setting of constellations indicating that the
type of advice given by Hesiad continued to be used.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s13"></a>An early time scale based on 12 months of 30 days did
not work well since the moon rapidly gets out of phase with a 30 day
month. So by 600 BC this had been replaced by a year of 6 'full' months
of 30 days and 6 'empty' months of 29 days. This improvement in keeping
the moon in phase with the month had the unfortunate effect of taking
the year even further out of phase with the period of the recurring
seasons. About the same time as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Thales.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Thales',550,800); return false;">Thales</a>
was making the first steps in philosophy, Solon, a statesman in Athens
who became known as one of the Seven Wise Men of Greece, introduced an
improved calendar.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s15"></a>Solon's calendar was based on a two yearly cycle.
There were 13 months of 30 days and 12 months of 29 days in each period
of two years so this gave a year of about 369 days and a month of 29<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
days. However, the Greeks relied mainly on the moon as their
time-keeper and frequent adjustments to the calendar were necessary to
keep it in phase with the moon and the seasons. Astronomy was clearly a
subject of major practical importance in sorting out the mess of these
calendars and so observations began to be made to enable better schemes
to be devised.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s17"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Pythagoras.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Pythagoras',550,800); return false;">Pythagoras</a>,
around 500 BC, made a number of important advances in astronomy. He
recognised that the earth was a sphere, probably more because he
believed that a sphere was the most perfect shape than for genuine
scientific reasons. He also recognised that the orbit of the Moon was
inclined to the equator of the Earth and he was one of the first to
realise that Venus as an evening star was the same planet as Venus as a
morning star. There is a pleasing appeal to observational evidence in
these discoveries, but <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Pythagoras.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Pythagoras',550,800); return false;">Pythagoras</a>
had a philosophy based on mathematical 'perfection' which tended to
work against a proper scientific approach. On the other side there is
an important idea in the Pythagorean philosophy which had a lasting
impact, namely the idea that all complex phenomena must reduce to
simple ones. One should not underestimate the importance of this idea
which has proved so powerful throughout the development of science,
being a fundamental driving force to the great scientists such as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> and particularly <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s19"></a>Around 450 BC <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Oenopides.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Oenopides',550,800); return false;">Oenopides</a> is said to have discovered the ecliptic made an angle of 24° with the equator, which was accepted in Greece until refined by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eratosthenes.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eratosthenes',550,800); return false;">Eratosthenes</a>
in around 250 BC. Some scholars accept that he discovered that the
ecliptic was at an angle but doubt that he measured the angle. Whether
he learnt of the 12 signs of the zodiac from scholars in Mesopotamia or
whether his discoveries were independent Greek discoveries is unknown. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Oenopides.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Oenopides',550,800); return false;">Oenopides</a>
is also credited with suggesting a calendar involving a 59 year cycle
with 730 months. Other schemes proposed were 8 year cycles, with extra
months in three of the eight years and there is evidence that this
scheme was adopted. </p><p align="justify">
<a name="s21"></a>About the same time as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Oenopides.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Oenopides',550,800); return false;">Oenopides</a>
proposed his 59 year cycle, Philolaus who was a Pythagorean, also
proposed a 59 year cycle based on 729 months. This seemed to owe more
to the numerology of the Pythagoreans than to astronomy since 729 is 27<sup>2</sup>, 27 being the Pythagorean number for the moon, while it is also 9<sup>3</sup>,
9 being the Pythagorean number associated with the earth. Philolaus is
also famed as the first person who we know to propose that the earth
moves. He did not have it orbiting the sun, however, but rather all the
heavenly bodies went in circles round a central fire which one could
never see since there was a counter earth between the earth and the
fire. This model, certainly not suggested by any observational
evidence, is more likely to have been proposed so that there were 10
heavenly bodies, for 10 was the most perfect of all numbers to the
Pythagoreans.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s23"></a>Meton, in 432 BC, introduced a calendar based on a 19
year cycle but again this is similar to one devised in Mesopotamia some
years earlier. Meton worked in Athens with another astronomer Euctemon,
and they made a series of observations of the solstices (the points at
which the sun is at greatest distance from the equator) in order to
determine the length of the tropical year. Again we do not know if the
19 year cycle was an independent discovery or whether Greek advances
were still based on earlier advances in Mesopotamia. Meton's calendar
never seems to have been adopted in practice but his observations
proved extremely useful to later Greek astronomers such as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hipparchus',550,800); return false;">Hipparchus</a> and <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a>. 
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s25"></a>That Meton was famous and widely known is seen from
the play Birds written by Aristopenes in about 414 BC. Two characters
are speaking, one is Meton [see D Barrett (trs.), Aristophanes, Birds
(London, 1978)]:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s27"></a>Meton: <i>I propose to survey the air for you: it will have to be marked out in acres.</i>
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s29"></a>Peisthetaerus: <i>Good lord, who do you think you are?</i>
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s31"></a>Meton: <i>Who am I? Why Meton. THE Meton. Famous throughout the Hellenic world - you must have heard of my hydraulic clock at Colonus?</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s33"></a>Meton and Euctemon are associated with another important astronomical invention of the time, namely a <i>parapegma</i>.
A parapegma was a stone tablet with movable pegs and an inscription to
indicate the approximate correspondence between, for example, the
rising of a particular star and the civil date. Because the calendar
had to be changed regularly to keep the civil calendar in phase with
the astronomical one, the parapegma had movable pegs which could be
adjusted as necessary. A parapegma soon also contained meteorological
forecasts associated with the risings and settings of the stars and not
only were stone parapegma constructed but also ones on papyri. Meton
and Euctemon are usually acknowledged as the inventors of parapegmata
and certainly many later astronomers compiled the data nessary for
their construction.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s35"></a>There is evidence for other observational work being undertaken around this time, for <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Vitruvius.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Vitruvius',550,800); return false;">Vitruvius</a> claims that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Democritus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Democritus',550,800); return false;">Democritus</a> of Abdera, famed for his atomic theory, devised a star catalogue. We have no knowledge of the form this catalogue took but <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Democritus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Democritus',550,800); return false;">Democritus</a> may well have described the major constellations in some way.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s37"></a>The beginning of the 4<sup>th</sup> century BC was the time that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Plato.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Plato',550,800); return false;">Plato</a> began his teachings and his writing was to have a major influence of Greek thought. As far as astronomy is concerned <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Plato.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Plato',550,800); return false;">Plato</a> had a negative effect, for although he mentions the topic many times, no dialogue is devoted to astronomy. Worse still, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Plato.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Plato',550,800); return false;">Plato</a>
did not believe in astronomy as a practical subject, and condemned as
lowering the spirit the actual observation of the heavenly bodies. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Plato.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Plato',550,800); return false;">Plato</a>
only believed in astronomy to the extent that it encouraged the study
of mathematics and suggested beautiful geometrical theories.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s39"></a>Perhaps we should digress for a moment to think about how the ideas of philosophy which were being developed by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Plato.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Plato',550,800); return false;">Plato</a> and others affected the development of astronomy. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Neugebauer.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Neugebauer',550,800); return false;">Neugebauer</a> [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20%20O%20Neugebauer,%20<i>A%20history%20of%20ancient%20mathematical%20astronomy</i>%20%20(New%20York,%201975).',6)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">6</a>] feels that philosophy had a detrimental affect:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s41"></a><i>I see no need for considering Greek philosophy as
an early stage in the development of science ... One need only read the
gibberish of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Proclus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Proclus',550,800); return false;">Proclus</a>'s  introduction to his huge commentary on Book I of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Euclid.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Euclid',550,800); return false;">Euclid</a>'s
Elements to get a vivid picture of what would have become of science in
the hands of philosophers. The real "Greek miracle" is the fact that a
scientific methodology was developed, and survived, in spite of a
widely admired dogmatic philosophy.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s43"></a>Although there is some truth in what <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Neugebauer.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Neugebauer',550,800); return false;">Neugebauer</a>
writes here, I [EFR] feel that he has overstated his case. It is true
that philosophers came up with ideas about the universe which were not
based on what we would call today the scientific method. However, the
very fact that theories were proposed which could be shown to be false
by making observations, must have provided a climate where the
scientific approach could show its strength. Also the fact the
philosophy taught that one should question all things, even "obvious"
truths, was highly beneficial. Another important philosophical idea
which had important consequences from the time of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Pythagoras.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Pythagoras',550,800); return false;">Pythagoras</a>, and was emphasised by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Plato.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Plato',550,800); return false;">Plato</a>, was that complex phenomena must be consequences of basic simple phenomena. As <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Theon_of_Smyrna.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Theon_of_Smyrna',550,800); return false;">Theon of Smyrna</a> expressed it, writing in the first century AD:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s45"></a><i>The changing aspects of the revolution of the
planets is because, being fixed in their own circles or in their own
shperes whose movements they follow, they are carried across the
zodiac, just as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Pythagoras.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Pythagoras',550,800); return false;">Pythagoras</a>
had first understood it, by a regulated simple and equal revolution but
which results by combination in a movement that appears variable and
unequal.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s47"></a>This led <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Theon_of_Smyrna.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Theon_of_Smyrna',550,800); return false;">Theon</a> to write:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s49"></a><i>It is natural and necessary that all the heavenly bodies have a uniform and regular movement.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s51"></a>Perhaps the most telling argument against the above claim by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Neugebauer.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Neugebauer',550,800); return false;">Neugebauer</a> is that our present idea of space-time, as developed from <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s theory of relativity, was suggested more by the basic philosophy of simplicity than by experimental evidence.

incorporating the idea of basic simplicity as expressed in Pythagorean
and Platonic philosophy, were made by an outstanding mathematician and
astronomer. In fact <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eudoxus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eudoxus',550,800); return false;">Eudoxus</a>
marks the beginning of a new phase in Greek astronomy and must figure
as one of a small number of remarkable innovators in astronomical
thought. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eudoxus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eudoxus',550,800); return false;">Eudoxus</a>
was the first to propose a model whereby the apparently complex motions
of the heavenly bodies did indeed result from simple circular motion.
He built an observatory on Cnidus and from there he observed the star
Canopus. The star Canopus played an important role in early astronomy,
for it is seen to set and rise in Cnidus yet one does no have to go
much further north from there before it can never be seen. The
observations made at <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eudoxus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eudoxus',550,800); return false;">Eudoxus</a>'s
observatory in Cnidus, as well as those made at an observatory near
Heliopolis, formed the basis of a book concerning the rising and
setting of the constellations. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eudoxus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eudoxus',550,800); return false;">Eudoxus</a>,
another who followed Pythagorean doctrines, proposed a beautiful
mathematical theory of concentric spheres to describe the motion of the
heavenly bodies. It is clear that Eudoxus thought of this as a
mathematical theory, and did not believe in the spheres as physical
objects.
</p><p align="justify">

accepted the theory, not not as a mathematical model as originally
proposed, but rather as spheres which have physical reality. He
discussed the interactions of one sphere on another, but there is no
way that he could have had enough understanding of physics to get
anywhere near describing the effects of such an interaction. Although
in many areas <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristotle.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristotle',550,800); return false;">Aristotle</a>
advocated a modern scientific approach and he collected data in a
scientific way, this was unfortunately not the case in astronomy. As
Berry writes [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20%20A%20Berry,%20<i>A%20short%20history%20of%20astronomy</i>%20%20(New%20York,%201961).',2)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">2</a>]:-

had an authority for many centuries which meant that astronomers had a
harder battle than they might otherwise have had in getting the truth
accepted.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s61"></a>The next development which was absolutely necessary
for progress in astronomy took place in geometry. Spherical geometry
was developed by a number of mathematicians with an important text
being written by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Autolycus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Autolycus',550,800); return false;">Autolycus</a> in Athens around 330 BC. Some claim that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Autolycus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Autolycus',550,800); return false;">Autolycus</a> based his work on spherical geometry <i>On the Moving Sphere </i> on an earlier work by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eudoxus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eudoxus',550,800); return false;">Eudoxus</a>. Whether or not this is the case there is no doubt that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Autolycus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Autolycus',550,800); return false;">Autolycus</a> was strongly influenced by the views of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eudoxus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eudoxus',550,800); return false;">Eudoxus</a> on astronomy. Like so many astronomers, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Autolycus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Autolycus',550,800); return false;">Autolycus</a> wrote a work <i>On Risings and Settings</i>  which is a book on observational astronomy.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s63"></a>After <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Autolycus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Autolycus',550,800); return false;">Autolycus</a> the main place for major developments in astronomy seemed to move to Alexandria. There <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Euclid.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Euclid',550,800); return false;">Euclid</a> worked and wrote on geometry in general but also making an important contribution to spherical geometry. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Euclid.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Euclid',550,800); return false;">Euclid</a> also wrote  <i>Phaenomena</i>
which is an elementary introduction to mathematical astronomy and gives
results on the times stars in certain positions will rise and set.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s65"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a>,
Timocharis and Aristyllus were three astronomers who all worked at
Alexandria and their lives certainly overlapped. Aristyllus was a pupil
of Timocharis and in Maeyama [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20Y%20Maeyama,%20Ancient%20stellar%20observations%20:%20Timocharis,%20Aristyllus,%20Hipparchus,%20Ptolemy%20-%20the%20dates%20and%20accuracies,%20<i>Centaurus</i>%20%20<b>27</b>%20(3-4)%20(1984),%20280-310.',23)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">23</a>]
analyses 18 of their observations and shows that Timocharis observed
around 290 BC while Aristyllus observed a generation later around 260
BC. He also reports an astounding accuracy of 5' for Aristyllus'
observations. Maeyama writes [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20Y%20Maeyama,%20Ancient%20stellar%20observations%20:%20Timocharis,%20Aristyllus,%20Hipparchus,%20Ptolemy%20-%20the%20dates%20and%20accuracies,%20<i>Centaurus</i>%20%20<b>27</b>%20(3-4)%20(1984),%20280-310.',23)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">23</a>]:-

<a name="s67"></a><i>The order of accuracy is an essential measure for
the development of natural sciences. accuracy is in fact more than the
mere operation of measuring. Accuracy increases only by virtue of
active measuring. There cannot exist a high order of observational

Hence my assumption is that there must have been abundant accurate
observations of the fixed stars made at least at the epochs </i>300 BC - 250 BC<i> in Alexandria. They must have disappeared in the fires which frequently raged there.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s69"></a>Maeyama also points out that this is the period when
the coordinate systems for giving stellar positions originated. Both
the equatorial and the ecliptic systems appear at this time. But why
were these observations being made? This is a difficult question to
answer for on the face of it there seems little point in the
astronomers of Alexandria striving for observational accuracy at this
time. In [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20B%20L%20van%20der%20Waerden,%20The%20motion%20of%20Venus,%20Mercury%20and%20the%20Sun%20in%20early%20Greek%20astronomy,%20<i>Arch.%20Hist.%20Exact%20Sci.</i>%20%20<b>26</b>%20(2)%20(1982),%2099-113.',34)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">34</a>] <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Van_der_Waerden.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Van_der_Waerden',550,800); return false;">van der Waerden</a> makes an interesting suggestion related to the other important astronomer who worked in Alexandria around this time, namely <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a>.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s71"></a>We know that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a>
measured the ratio of the distances to the moon and to the sun and,
although his methods could never yield accurate results, they did show
that the sun was much further from the earth than was the moon. His
results also showed that the sun was much larger than the earth,
although again his measurements were very inaccurate. Some historians
believe that this knowledge that the sun was the largest of the three
bodies, earth, moon and sun, led him to propose his heliocentric
theory. Certainly it is for this theory, as reported by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Archimedes.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Archimedes',550,800); return false;">Archimedes</a>, that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a>
has achieved fame. His sun-centred universe found little favour with
the Greeks, however, who continued to develop more and more
sophisticated models based on an earth centred universe.

attempt to answer the question of why Timocharis and Aristyllus made
their accurate observations. These authors do not find a clear purpose
for the observations, such as the marking of a globe. However <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Van_der_Waerden.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Van_der_Waerden',550,800); return false;">van der Waerden</a> in [<a href="javascript:ref('%20%20B%20L%20van%20der%20Waerden,%20The%20motion%20of%20Venus,%20Mercury%20and%20the%20Sun%20in%20early%20Greek%20astronomy,%20<i>Arch.%20Hist.%20Exact%20Sci.</i>%20%20<b>26</b>%20(2)%20(1982),%2099-113.',34)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">34</a>] suggests that the observations were made to determine the constants in the heliocentric theory of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a>.
Although this theory has strong attractions, and makes one want to
believe in it, all the evidence suggests that Timocharis certainly
began his observations some time before <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a> proposed his heliocentric universe.

make other interesting suggestions. They believe that the observations
of Timocharis and Aristyllus recorded the distance from the pole, and
the distances between stars. They argued that the observations were
made by means of an instrument similar to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Heron.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Heron',550,800); return false;">Heron</a>'s
dioptra. These are interesting observations since the work of
Timocharis and Aristyllus strongly influenced the most important of all
of the Greek astronomers, namely <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hipparchus',550,800); return false;">Hipparchus</a>, who made his major contribution about 100 years later. During these 100 years, however,  there were a number of advances. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Archimedes.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Archimedes',550,800); return false;">Archimedes</a> measured the apparent diameter of the sun and also is said to have designed a planetarium. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eratosthenes.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eratosthenes',550,800); return false;">Eratosthenes</a> made important measurements of the size of the earth, accurately measured the angle of the ecliptic and improved the calendar. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Apollonius.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Apollonius',550,800); return false;">Apollonius</a> used his geometric skills to mathematically develop the epicycle theory which would reach its full importance in the work of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a>.

approach to science that ranks him far above other ancient astronomers.
His approach, based on data from accurate observations, is essentially
modern in that he collected his data and then formed his theories to
fit the observed facts. Most telling regarding his understanding of the
scientific method is the fact that he proposed a theory of the motion
of the sun and the moon yet he was not prepared to propose such a
theory for the planets. He realised that his data was not sufficiently
good or sufficiently plentiful to allow him to base a theory on it.
However, he made observations to help his successors to develop such a
theory. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Delambre.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Delambre',550,800); return false;">Delambre</a>, in his famous work on the history of astronomy, writes:-

invented or perfected, and reflect upon the number of his works and the
mass of calculations which they imply, we must regard him as one of the
most astonishing men of antiquity, and as the greatest of all in the
sciences which are not purely speculative, and which require a
combination of geometrical knowledge with a knowledge of phenomena, to
be observed only by diligent attention and refined instruments.</i>
