Four thousand years ago the Babylonians were skilled astronomers who
were able to predict the apparent motions of the moon and the stars and
the planets and the Sun upon the sky, and could even predict eclipses.
But it was the Ancient Greeks who were the first to build a
cosmological model within which to interpret these motions. In the
fourth century BC, they developed the idea that the stars were fixed on
a celestial sphere which rotated about the spherical Earth every 24
hours, and the planets, the Sun and the Moon, moved in the ether
between the Earth and the stars.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="4"></a>This model was further developed in the following centuries, culminating in the second century AD with <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a>'s
great system. Perfect motion should be in circles, so the stars and
planets, being heavenly objects, moved in circles. However, to account
for the complicated motion of the planets, which appear to periodically
loop back upon themselves, epicycles had to be introduced so that the
planets moved in circles upon circles about the fixed Earth.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="6"></a>Despite its complicated structure, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a> produced a model so successful at reproducing the apparent motion of the planets that when, in the sixteenth century, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Copernicus',550,800); return false;">Copernicus</a> proposed a heliocentric system, he could not match the accuracy of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a>'s Earth-centred system. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Copernicus',550,800); return false;">Copernicus</a>
constructed a model where the Earth rotated and, together with the
other planets, moved in a circular orbit about the Sun. But the
observational evidence of the time favoured the Ptolemaic system!
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="8"></a>There were other practical reasons why many astronomers
of the time rejected the Copernican notion that the Earth orbited the
Sun. Tycho <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Brahe.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Brahe',550,800); return false;">Brahe</a>
was the greatest astronomer of his the sixteenth century. He realised
that if the Earth was moving about the Sun, then the relative positions
of the stars should change as viewed from different parts of the
Earth's orbit. But there was no evidence of this shift, called
parallax. Either the Earth was fixed, or else the stars would have to
be fantastically far away.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="10"></a>It was only with the aid of the newly-invented telescope in the early seventeenth century that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a>
could deal a fatal blow to the notion that the Earth was at the centre
of the Universe. He discovered moons orbiting the planet Jupiter. And
if moons could orbit another planet, why could not the planets orbit
the Sun?
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="12"></a>At the same time, Tycho <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Brahe.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Brahe',550,800); return false;">Brahe</a>'s assistant <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Kepler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Kepler',550,800); return false;">Kepler</a> discovered the key to building a heliocentric model. The planets moved in ellipses, not perfect circles, about the Sun. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> later showed that elliptical motion could be explained by his inverse-square law for the gravitational force.
</p><p align="justify">But the absence of any observable parallax in
the apparent positions of the stars as the Earth rotated the Sun, then
implied that the stars must be at a huge distance from the Sun. The
cosmos seemed to be a vast sea of stars. With the aid of his telescope,
<a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a> could resolve thousands of new stars which were invisible to the naked eye. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a> concluded that the Universe must be an infinite and eternal sea of stars, each much like our own Sun.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="16"></a>It was not until in the nineteenth century that the astronomer and mathematician <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Bessel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Bessel',550,800); return false;">Bessel</a>
finally measured the distance to the stars by parallax. The nearest
star (other than the Sun) turned out to be about 25 million, million
miles away! (By contrast the Sun is a mere 93 million miles away from
the Earth.)
</p><p align="justify">Most of the stars we can see are contained in
the Milky Way - the bright band of stars that stretches across our
night sky. Kant and others proposed that our Milky Way was in fact a
lens shaped "island universe'' or galaxy, and that beyond our own Milky
Way must be other galaxies.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="20"></a>As well as stars and planets, astronomers had noted
fuzzy patches of light on the night sky, which they called nebulae.
Some astronomers thought these could be distant galaxies. It was only
in the 1920's that the American astronomer <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> established that some of these nebulae were indeed distant galaxies comparable in size to our own Milky Way.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="22"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>
also made the remarkable discovery that these galaxies seemed to be
moving away from us, with a speed proportional to their distance from
us. It was soon realised that this had a very natural explanation in
terms of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s recently discovered General Theory of Relativity: our Universe is expanding! 
</p><p align="justify">
In fact, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>
might have predicted that the Universe is expanding after he first
proposed his theory in 1915. Matter tends to fall together under
gravity so it was impossible to have a static universe. However, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>
realised he could introduce a arbitrary constant into his mathematical
equations, which could balance the gravitational force and keep the
galaxies apart. This became known as the cosmological constant. After
it was discovered that the Universe was actually expanding, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> declared that introducing the cosmological constant was the greatest blunder of his life! 
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="26"></a>The Russian mathematician and meteorologist <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Friedmann.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Friedmann',550,800); return false;">Friedmann</a> had realised in 1917 that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>
equations could describe an expanding universe. This solution implied
that the Universe had been born at one moment, about ten thousand
million years ago in the past and the galaxies were still travelling
away from us after that initial burst. All the matter, indeed the
Universe itself, was created at just one instant. The British
astronomer Fred Hoyle dismissively called it the "Big Bang'', and the
name stuck.
</p><p align="justify">There was a rival model, called the Steady
State theory - advocated by Bondi, Gold and Hoyle - developed to
explain the expansion of the Universe. This required the continuous
creation of matter to produce new galaxies as the universe expanded,
ensuring that the Universe could be expanding, but still unchanging in
time.
</p><p align="justify">For many years it seemed a purely academic
point, whether the universe was eternal and unchanging, or had only
existed for a finite length of time. But a decisive blow was dealt to
the Steady State model when in 1965 Penzias and Wilson discovered a
cosmic microwave background radiation. This was interpreted as the
faint afterglow of the intense radiation of a Hot Big Bang, which had
been predicted by Alpher and Hermann back in 1949.
</p><p align="justify">Following on from earlier work by Gamow, Alpher
and Herman in the 1940's, theorists calculated the relative abundances
of the elements hydrogen and helium that might be produced in a Hot Big
Bang and found it was in good agreement with the observations. When the
abundance of other light elements was calculated these too were
consistent with the values observed.
</p><p align="justify">Since the 1970's almost all cosmologists have
come to accept the Hot Big Bang model and have begun asking more
specific, but still fundamental, questions about our Universe. How did
the galaxies and clusters of galaxies that we observe today form out of
the primordial expansion. What is most of the matter in the Universe
made of? How do we know that there are not black holes or some kind of
dark matter out there which does not shine like stars? General
relativity tells us that matter curves space-time, so what shape is the
Universe? Is there a cosmological constant after all?
</p><p align="justify">We are only beginning to find answers to some
of these questions. The cosmic microwave background radiation plays a
key role as it gives us a picture of the universe as it was only a
hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. It turns out to be so
remarkably uniform, that it was only in 1992 that NASA's Cosmic
Background Explorer satellite detected the first anisotropies in this
background radiation. There are slight fluctuations in the temperature
of the radiation, about one part in a hundred thousand, which may be
the seeds from which galaxies formed.
</p><p align="justify">Since the early 1980's there has been an
explosion of interest in the physics of the early universe. New
technology and satellite experiments, such as the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>
Space Telescope, have brought us an ever improving picture of our
Universe, inspiring theorists to produce ever more daring models,
drawing upon the latest ideas in relativity and particle physics.
