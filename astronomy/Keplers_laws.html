<p align="justify">
This account of Kepler's mathematical astronomy may well challenge some
cherished and long-held beliefs, since most of what has been written
about Kepler has either been based on secondary or tertiary sources, or
has concentrated on his astronomical background and techniques. But
Kepler was a highly-talented geometer, and until now has there been no
investigation of his work (derived from the original Latin) which has
highlighted the mathematical aspect of his brilliance. While analysis
of his success has led to some unexpected conclusions, the present
overview has been endorsed in detail by articles published in learned
historical journals. These are listed on the web site mentioned at the
end; they also contain references to traditional accounts which are
becoming superseded.
</p><p align="justify">The greatest achievement of Kepler (1571-1630)
was his discovery of the laws of planetary motion. There were such
three laws, but here we shall deal only with the first two - those that
govern the motion of an individual planet. These are found in <i>Astronomia Nova</i> (New Astronomy, 1609), underpinned by important work in <i>Epitome</i> (of Copernican Astronomy) Book V (1621).  The laws are:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>Law I (the Ellipse Law) - the curve or path of a planet is an <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/ellipse',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">ellipse</font></a> whose radius vector is measured from the Sun which is fixed at one focus.
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li>Law II (the Area Law) - the time taken by a planet to
reach a particular position is represented by the area swept out by the
radius vector drawn from the fixed Sun.<br>
</li></ul>
From these we can find either what the position of the planet is at a
given time, or, the time when the planet is in a given position. (The
time is measured by the fraction of the total time taken for the planet
to complete one whole circuit, that being called its period <i>T</i>.
Kepler followed the ancients in always starting to measure at the point
furthest from the Sun.) Almost certainly Kepler was responsible for
introducing the term '<a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/orbit',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">orbit</font></a>', in <i>Astronomia Nova</i>
Ch.1, and on his behalf we shall precisely define an orbit as
possessing a pair of independent constituents: the path or curve,
together with a (geometrical) way of representing time. (The term
'orb', used previously, had an entirely different connotation.)
<p align="justify">Kepler's principal aim was to find a solution that
would satisfy observations - and in that respect he possessed the
outlook of a modern scientist. Moreover, Renaissance scientists
considered it their duty to reveal the way in which Nature worked by
explaining the observed outcome by the simplest means available.
Strongly influenced both by Plato and by his underlying belief in God,
Kepler believed more intensely than his contemporaries in the power of
mathematics to expose the order in the universe that lay behind
apparent complication, and he applied this criterion of simplicity with
great effect in his astronomy.
</p><p align="justify">
There is much additional information, both on the circumstances of Kepler's life, and the context in which he worked, in the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Kepler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Kepler',550,800); return false;">MacTutor biography</a>.  This will provide useful background to the present detailed account of his astronomical work.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="2"></a></p><h2>Section 2  <font color="blue">Observational background</font></h2>
<p align="justify">
Kepler originally investigated the orbit of Mars because that was the task allocated to him by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Brahe.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Brahe',550,800); return false;">Tycho Brahe</a>
(1546-1601), when Kepler joined him in Prague around 1600. In their day
- and indeed until comparatively recently - the aim of astronomers was
to achieve accurate observations of angles, simply because no other
feature could be measured directly. Tycho had amassed a vast store of
observations extending over 30 years; these are probably the most
accurate that would ever be made with the naked eye, since <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a>
(1564-1642) had introduced the telescope into astronomy soon afterwards
(in 1610). Tycho developed, refined and cross-checked his instruments
and sometimes attained an accuracy of 2' (which is approximately the
breadth of a hair held at arm's length). </p><p align="justify">
It so happens that Mars is the only planet whose noncircularity can be
detected without a telescope, and its observability was favoured by
four factors:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>it is an outer planet (and therefore it is seldom viewed close to the Sun);<br>
</li><li>the noncircularity of its path is the greatest of the outer planets;<br>
</li><li>it is the nearest to the Earth of the outer planets (so changes in position appear larger);<br>
</li><li>it is the nearest to the Sun of the outer planets (and therefore it makes more frequent circuits, producing more observations).<br>
</li></ul>
<br>
<a name="3"></a><h2>Section 3  <font color="blue">Copernican conviction</font></h2>
<p align="justify">
Since Greek times, the accepted description of the planetary system had
been a geometrical one, known as the Ptolemaic theory (a <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/geocentric_configuration',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">geocentric configuration</font></a>),
which supposed that the Earth was fixed at the centre of the universe,
with the Moon, the Sun, and the five known (naked-eye) planets
revolving round it. Geocentricity was obviously in accordance with the
evidence of the senses - as well as being the only arrangement
acceptable to the Church - by contrast with the Copernican theory (a <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/heliocentric_configuration',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">heliocentric configuration</font></a>), which was proposed in 1543 by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Copernicus',550,800); return false;">Copernicus</a>
(1473-1543). Kepler was introduced to Copernicanism as a student at the
University of Tübingen by his teacher, Michael Maestlin (1550-1631).
Though his contemporaries were in general slow to recognize any
advantages in this new idea, Kepler adopted the Copernican theory
enthusiastically, because of its greater simplicity - which allowed him
to abandon the set of (five) large and cumbersome epicycles that
occurred in the Ptolemaic theory (they accounted for what we now
recognize as the actual motion of the Earth). In fact, Kepler gave
Copernican theory a new, mathematical precision by specifying two
fundamental properties that were consistent with his conviction that
the Sun was metaphorically the place of God:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>The Sun is the fixed hub of the universe. This was bounded by the
fixed stars and consisted of the six known (primary) planets, now
including the Earth, with the Moon downgraded as its satellite (a term
coined by Kepler himself);
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li>The Sun is responsible for all celestial motion.<br>
</li></ul>Thus Kepler's interpretation of heliocentricity provided him
with an origin from which to determine the Sun-planet distances and so
discover the actual path of the planet. This was an immensely
significant breakthrough in itself, and additionally it meant that he
was freed from the restrictions of the precept (traditionally
attributed to Plato), which had dominated the approach of previous
astronomers, including Copernicus; this precept required that
everything that happened in the heavens should be accounted for by
uniform motions in perfect circles. Kepler's new astronomy was, indeed,
founded on circles, but there was a different reason for this, as we
shall explain in Section 5.
<p align="justify">
<a name="4"></a></p><h2>Section 4  <font color="blue">Reduction of observations leading to idealization</font></h2>
<p align="justify">
In the earlier chapters of <i>Astronomia Nova</i>
Kepler embarked on a programme of 'reducing the observations' (this
term means removing, as far as possible, all effects due to the
observer's position in time and space). He found the heavy
calculations, and the necessary checking, 'mechanical and tedious', as
he remarked later: he did not have the benefit of logarithms, which
were not invented until 1614, by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Napier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Napier',550,800); return false;">Napier</a> (1550-1617).  Kepler carried out the reduction to heliocentricity, and further simplifying procedures, in a series of steps:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>	In order to transpose the observations from a geocentric to a heliocentric basis, he applied <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/triangulation',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">triangulation</font></a>
to ensure that each Mars-distance was measured as if from the fixed
Sun. Bearing in mind that the observations contained no
distance-measurements (as explained in Section 2), this involved
expressing all the Mars-Sun distances in terms of the Earth-Sun
distance, regarded as a standard unit or 'baseline' (since the path of
the Earth is very nearly circular, this approximation happened to be
accurate enough for Kepler's purpose);
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li>	He verified that the path of each planet lay in a plane that passed through the Sun;
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li> He checked that the observations were compatible with the
fact that the curve described by the planet possessed a single axis of
symmetry - identified as the line of <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/apsides',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">apsides</font></a>;
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li>	Finally, he tabulated the average values of the <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/secular_changes',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">secular changes</font></a>,
from knowledge accumulated over many centuries,which accounted for many
of the small remaining irregularities. Thus Kepler knew the angular
amount he should allow as compensation for them.<br>
</li></ul>
To provide the foundation for his new approach to astronomy, Kepler
adopted the simplest geometrical structure consistent with
observations. Accordingly, when he had carried out the procedures
listed above, he felt justified in assuming that a single, closed
(repeating) planar curve would represent the path of the planet; this
assumption implied a process these days called idealization (neglect of
the presence of other bodies in the universe, as we now know). Such a
structural simplification allowed Kepler to examine the orbit of each
individual planet in isolation, because all mutual interactions between
planets had been eliminated. And because it was expressed
geometrically, the solution would potentially be exact - the closed
orbit of a single planet in a plane round the fixed Sun.
<p align="justify">
<a name="5"></a></p><h2>Section 5  <font color="blue">Essential orthogonality of Euclid's geometry</font></h2>
<p align="justify">In Kepler's day modern algebraic notation and
techniques were just being developed, but for his approach to astronomy
Kepler depended exclusively on the traditional geometry of Euclid in
which he had been trained at the University of Tübingen, as part of the
standard preparation for the ministry. (This was originally Kepler's
intended profession, and all his life he remained a devout, though
somewhat unorthodox, Lutheran). Euclid's <i>Elements</i>
rigorously laid down (in the first three Postulates) that the only
means of construction permitted were the straightedge (an unmarked
ruler) and compasses. Thus, the distinguishing feature of the geometry
of <i>Elements</i> was that it relied on straight lines and circles
alone. These were then combined in one of Euclid's earliest
propositions concerning circles, which stated in effect that where the
diameter of a circle meets its circumference a right angle will occur.
It is well-known that a pair of (mathematically-defined) directed
quantities are mutually independent if and only if they are at right
angles: using Euclid's term 'orthogonal' for mutually perpendicular (it
was defined in <i>Elements</i> Book I), this will be named the
Principle of Orthogonal Independence; it will, with hindsight, justify
our separate treatment of the path and the time-measure. (Moreover, the
same principle is invoked in relation to planetary motion when Kepler
based his investigation on what Aristotle had specified as the only two
simple motions, circular and rectilinear, discussed in Section 9.) This
principle has far-reaching ramifications, as we will demonstrate in
connection with the complementary pairings that recur in Kepler's
mature work in <i>Epitome</i> Book V (1621) - where the term
'complementary' is used in the everyday sense that the pair complete
one another, and also with the mathematical connotation of being at
right angles. Application of the principle gives rise to an enormous
leap in simplicity, since it is intuitively obvious that it will be
easier to treat each one of a pair of components separately than to
work with the resultant produced by taking them in combination. For
Kepler, simplicity was the hallmark of his treatment, and contributed
overwhelmingly to his success.
</p><p align="justify">Kepler always showed the greatest respect for
his Greek predecessors, and read their works thoroughly, selecting
material that he could incorporate into his new astronomical synthesis.
Apart from frequent application of the trigonometrical propositions of
Ptolemy (fl. 129-141 AD), Kepler made use of precisely three
propositions from the work of Archimedes; one of these was vital in
supplying the geometrical backing for Section 6 (the other two - one
cited in Section 7, one in Section 11 - were concerned with an
innovative approach to 'infinitesimal' considerations which went well
beyond traditional geometry). However, it will come as a surprise to
some readers to find that Kepler did not rely on Apollonius anywhere in
his astronomical work. Sometime in the years 1594-1604, Kepler studied
the <i>Conics</i> of Apollonius, and expressed great admiration for it, citing it throughout his optical and <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/stereometrical',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">stereometrical</font></a> work - yet he never referred to any of its propositions in connection with his astronomy.  This is because <i>Conics</i>
is expressed in terms of an oblique (non-orthogonal) frame of reference
(coordinate-system), which Kepler implicitly rejected as inappropriate
for the study of astronomy (nor did he need any of its propositions, as
we confirm in Section 6). Meanwhile we reiterate Kepler's belief that
Euclid's <i>Elements</i> encapsulated the only geometry that could
properly be applied to the heavens, which after all was the realm of
God. He labelled any other treatment 'ageometrical' - which, in his
mind, was akin to heretical.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="6"></a></p><h2>Section 6  <font color="blue">Constructing the path</font></h2>
<p align="justify">In spite of his splendid inheritance from Tycho,
Kepler knew that no amount of empirical observations, however numerous,
could give him the theoretical structure he required. Therefore, when
he had compensated for the observational uncertainties as far as
possible, Kepler switched to a geometrical investigation - see Figure
(1). He began by assuming a fixed/known line of apsides CD, on which
lies the fixed point A (the position of the Sun) at a known 'eccentric'
distance AB (all previously determined from Tycho's observations),
where B is the midpoint of CD. (From now on, as a convenience, we shall
use the algebraic notation BC = BD = <i>a</i>, AB = <i>ae</i>, even though it is an anachronism.)
</p><p align="justify">
</p><center><img src="Keplers_laws_files/Davis_fig1.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1</center>
<p align="justify">
Kepler started from the initial framework illustrated in Figure (1),
which could be described as standard Ptolemaic, except that Kepler
automatically transposed it from geocentric to heliocentric mode. He
adopted the traditional mechanism of deferent, epicycle, and <a href="javascript:win1('../Glossary/eccentric',350,200)" onmouseover="window.status='Click for glossary entry';return true"><font style="text-decoration: none;" color="green">eccentric</font></a>, being aware, as the Ancients had been, that motion in the circle of radius <i>a</i> centred on A, when combined with motion in the epicyclet of radius ZQ = AB = <i>ae</i>
(whose centre Z lies on the deferent), together produce a motion of Q
equivalent to a simple motion of Q round the eccentric circle centre B
radius <i>a</i>. (Mathematicians may like to regard ABQZ as a
'parallelogram of circular motions'.) We shall specify the typical
point of any of the three successive orbits proposed by Kepler just as
he did - determined by the angle at the centre of the eccentric circle,
which we shall denote by <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">
for distinctiveness. (This usage was authenticated by tradition, since
in ancient astronomy motions consisted of combinations of rotations
which were measured by the angles at the centres of their respective
circles.) Then we have corresponding angles from the parallels AZ and
BQ, so that:
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
 <img src="Keplers_laws_files/angle.gif" alt="angle">QBC =   <img src="Keplers_laws_files/angle.gif" alt="angle">ZAB = <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">.
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
This angle <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">
is called 'the eccentric anomaly' in both ancient and modern astronomy
(though we shall avoid that name here). The ordinate QH is also
extremely significant in Kepler's reasoning, as we shall demonstrate,
concentrating on the three main stages of Kepler's progress once he had
adopted the approach which would provide a rational route to his goal.
</p><p align="justify">At the first stage Kepler took Q on the
eccentric circle as the typical point and so he tested the eccentric
itself as a proposed path. However, he found that this placed the
planet too far from the Sun in almost all positions. So he finally
rejected the idea that each planet moved in a single circle, and set
out to find the actual curve that was the planet's path - naturally,
this had to be constructed from a combination of (arcs of) circles by
the geometry of Euclid, since Kepler recognized nothing else as
appropriate for the heavens.
</p><p align="justify">
</p><center><img src="Keplers_laws_files/Davis_fig2.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2</center>
<p align="justify">The typical points of the three successive proposed
paths are all named, and the separate constructions shown, in Figure
(2). It is evident that the structure needed to produce these points
already, or potentially, exists in Figure (1) in terms of a chosen
value QBC = <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">.  This is significant because - as we will see in Section 7 - the time is also expressed in terms of <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">, so a common value of <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">
ensures simultaneity. The three-stage procedure that Kepler adopted was
to take geometrically-defined points (K', K'', K) along AZ, one at each
stage in turn, then with centre A to draw the corresponding circular
arc (radius AK', AK'', AK), so that each arc would end at a
geometrically-defined point (Q, V, P) respectively. The stages are
classified according to the chapters of <i>Astronomia Nova</i> in whch each construction appears:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>First stage (Chs.39-44): large-grade curve - outer bound. In this
special case, AQ = AK' is constructed, but the typical point is already
known to be Q, on the eccentric.
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li>Second stage (Chs.45-50): small-grade curve - inner bound.
K'' lies on the eccentric, and AV = AK'' is constructed, to specify
typical point V lying on the epicycle. (Kepler tried many variations at
this stage, but this is the only ovoid to be properly defined).
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li>Third stage: medial-grade curve (Chs.51-60) -
observationally satisfactory. K lies where the perpendicular from Q
meets AZ, and AP = AK is constructed, to specify typical point P lying
on the ordinate QH.<br>
</li></ul>
By careful comparison with Tycho's observations, as always, Kepler
found that the first outcome (Q) was an overshoot, and the second (V)
an undershoot. Finally, the point P more-or-less in the middle turned
out to hit the target (to agree with observations). The martial analogy
- defeat of Mars, the god of war - was Kepler's own, as was the
description of the proposed non-circular curves he found, and named
'ovoid', or egg-shaped (always symmetrical about the line of apsides,
but never with any assumption of a second axis of symmetry). Even when
nothing more is known about these curves one can imagine applying a
mathematical 'grading-machine' to sort them by width, to produce BF',
BF'', BF, respectively, as shown in the figure (constructed as special
cases by the same procedure, taking <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta"> = 90<img src="Keplers_laws_files/degrees.gif" alt="degrees">).
<p align="justify">
</p><center><img src="Keplers_laws_files/Davis_fig3.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 3</center>
<p align="justify">
So the resulting radius vector AP that finally satisfied Kepler (in
Ch.58) was quantified geometrically from the constructed rectangle
AKQR, by applying nothing more than a Euclidean -
straightedge-and-compasses - construction, as shown in Figure (3):
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
AP = AK = QR = BQ + BR.
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
This relationship is nowadays known as Law I.
</p><p align="justify">
[It is expressed in modern terms for reference in the Summary Table at the end: also see the article <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Kepler_planetary_motion.html">Planetary motion tackled kinematically</a>.]
</p><p align="justify">However, such a construction had never been
invented before and Kepler did not have the slightest idea what curve
the above relationship represented. However, he did know that if the
curve were an ellipse, the typical point P would satisfy a vital
condition that he had come across in the work of Archimedes: <i>On Conoids and Spheroids</i> Prop.4 (where it was stated as if well known even then):
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
PH/QH = BF/BC
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
There is good reason to believe that this was the earliest plane definition of an ellipse [<a href="javascript:ref('Because%20it%20can%20be%20derived%20directly%20from%20a%20section%20of%20a%20cone%20in%20three%20easy%20steps,%20as%20demonstrated%20in%20section%206%20of%20A%20E%20L%20Davis,%20Some%20plane%20geometry%20from%20a%20cone:%20the%20focal%20distance%20of%20an%20ellipse%20at%20a%20glance,%20<i>Mathematical%20Gazette</i>,%20forthcoming%20July%202007.',1)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">1</a>],
as well as the one most commonly, if not exclusively, used by Kepler's
contemporaries: it is just the ratio-property of the ordinates. Some
people nowadays will recognize it as the 'compressed circle' property.
</p><p align="justify">The identification of the curve as an ellipse
also depends on a relationship that Kepler established in Ch. 59, Prop.
VII, which we express here in modern terms (writing BF = <i>b</i> to denote the minor semiaxis), recognizing that <i>e</i> will now represent the (focal) eccentricity:
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup><i>e</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
This may appropriately be called the 'focus-fixing property' of an
ellipse, since it determines the position of the focus when the major
and minor semiaxes are known. Kepler had already invented the term
'focus' in <i>Astronomiae Pars Optica</i>
(1604) in connection with his work on vision, though he did not realize
its connection with his astronomy at that juncture - in <i>Astronomia Nova</i> he simply referred to the point A as <i>punctum eccentricum</i>,
or eccentric point. Nevertheless, the position of the focus of this
particular ellipse is crucial. Unless its focus coincides with the
fixed Sun (the origin), the investigation would have been too
complicated to manage by geometry. Actually, Kepler's approach was
successful just because the ellipse is simpler than any circle in this
situation - an unlikely assertion which is proved in <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Kepler_planetary_motion.html">Planetary motion tackled kinematically</a>.
</p><p align="justify">
In <i>Astronomia Nova</i> Ch. 59, Prop. XI,
Kepler set out a rigorous geometrical proof that the typical point he
had constructed satisfied the ratio-property which defines an ellipse.
Hence, there can be no suggestion that Kepler merely selected an
ellipse and checked it against observations (as many readers may have
been told). Because of its importance the proof has been reproduced
several times [<a href="javascript:ref('Most%20accessibly%20in%20A%20E%20L%20Davis,%20Kepler\'s%20unintentional%20ellipse%20-%20a%20celestial%20detective%20story,%20<i>Mathematical%20Gazette</i>%20<b>82</b>,%20no.493%20(1998),%20p.42.',2)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">2</a>];
though modernized in style, and reordered - to increase its impact -
clearly it has not been altered in substance, since it relies on
nothing more 'advanced' than Pythagoras' Theorem, and properties of
similar triangles. Thus (apart from the use of relationship (1) above)
the proof is entirely based on cited or implied propositions from
Euclid's <i>Elements</i>.  Incidentally, this provides additional confirmation of my contention (in Section 5) that Kepler did not rely on the <i>Conics</i> of Apollonius for his discovery of the ellipse - in his astronomy he simply did not need anything so sophisticated.

<p align="justify">
This investigation took place alongside, but independently of, the
construction of the path of the planet. From a heliocentric point of
view, it is especially easy to be aware that planets move more slowly
the further they are from the Sun (and faster when nearer). Thus, as
Kepler realized, a connection exists between a small (micro) interval
of time and the corresponding distance of the planet from the Sun.
Kepler's practical problem in <i>Astronomia Nova</i>,
however, was to discover a way of measuring the time taken to reach the
typical position (P) of the planet at an intermediate point of the
orbit. Initially, he suggested that this (macro) time (the sum of the
micro intervals of time) could be represented geometrically by the sum
of all the corresponding distances from the Sun. In Ch.40, at the first
of the three stages set out in Section 6, Kepler put this into
practice, by citing Archimedes, <i>Measurement of a Circle</i>, Prop.3, to justify him in taking a sum of distances to be equivalent to the area of a sector of a circle.
</p><p align="justify">
</p><center><img src="Keplers_laws_files/Davis_fig4.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 4</center>
<p align="justify">
Next, Kepler extended that proposition, and took the distance-sum from
the eccentric point (A, the position of the Sun) to be (approximately)
proportional to the area of the eccentric sector (the area QAC, shown
in Figure (4)). Then he demonstrated geometrically how to find the area
of such a sector (devising alternative ways of splitting up the area as
he required them):
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
Eccentric sector QAC = circle sector QBC + <img src="Keplers_laws_files/bigdelta.gif" alt="bigdelta">QBA  = segment QHC + <img src="Keplers_laws_files/bigdelta.gif" alt="bigdelta">QHA.
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">At the second stage, various doubts
and distractions arose, but these were put aside by the third stage,
when Kepler discovered that the path was an ellipse (as described in
Section 6). In Ch.59, Prop.III, he applied the ratio-property of the
ordinates, illustrated in Figure (5), to obtain:
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
(Segment PHC) / (Segment QHC) = <i>b</i>/<i>a</i>.
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
Similarly, by Elements I, 39 we have:
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<img src="Keplers_laws_files/bigdelta.gif" alt="bigdelta">PHA / <img src="Keplers_laws_files/bigdelta.gif" alt="bigdelta">QHA  = <i>b</i>/<i>a</i>.
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
</p><center><img src="Keplers_laws_files/Davis_fig5.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 5</center>
<p align="justify">
Using these two results, Kepler deduced (again from Figure (5):
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
Ellipse sector PAC = ellipse segment PHC + <img src="Keplers_laws_files/bigdelta.gif" alt="bigdelta">PHA  = <font size="+1"><sup><i>b</i></sup>/<sub><i>a</i></sub></font> (segment QHC + <img src="Keplers_laws_files/bigdelta.gif" alt="bigdelta">QHA).
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
Hence,
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
Ellipse sector PAC =  <font size="+1"><sup><i>b</i></sup>/<sub><i>a</i></sub></font> circle sector QAC.
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
So, at the end of <i>Astronomia Nova</i>,
Kepler had discovered that, when the planet's path was an ellipse, time
in orbit appeared to be precisely proportional to the area swept out.
Thus the area-representation was altogether satisfactory in providing
an inherently quantifiable measure of time. (Kepler regarded his
initial suggestion, the distance-sum representation, as rather
unsatisfactory because it did not give a geometrical interpretation,
and so could not provide an exact result. The apparent
irreconcilability of the two representations was finally resolved, but
not until much later: see [<a href="javascript:ref('Fortunately,%20the%20incompatibility%20continued%20to%20worry%20Kepler,%20and%20motivated%20him%20eventually%20to%20work%20out%20a%20more%20effective%20approach%20to%20the%20mathematics%20of%20an%20elliptic%20orbit:%20see%20Sect.6%20of%20A%20E%20L%20Davis,%20The%20Mathematics%20of%20the%20Area%20Law:%20Kepler\'s%20successful%20proof%20in%20\'Epitome%20Astronomiae%20Copernicanae\'%20(1621)%20<i>Archive%20for%20History%20of%20Exact%20Sciences%20</i>%20%20<b>57</b>(5),%20355-393',3)" onmouseover="window.status='Click to see reference';return true">3</a>].)
</p><p align="justify">
[In modern algebraic terms it is easy to establish, from Figure (5), that:
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
Area of circle sector QAC =  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>.<img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta"> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>a</i><sup>2</sup><i>e</i> sin<img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">,

Since both areas are proportional to the time, from either relation one can deduce that:

<a name="8"></a></p><h2>Section 8  <font color="blue">Kepler's subsequent justification of the two laws</font></h2>
<p align="justify">This is where the accounts of Kepler's work
generally stop - but Kepler achieved much more. Firstly, between 1609
and 1618, he satisfied himself that the orbit of each of the six
primary planets was an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. He went on to
tackle the problem of the motions of planets, and their causes, in <i>Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae</i>.
This consists of seven books, though only Book V, supported in places
by Book IV, contains the really innovative work. Despite the title, it
epitomizes Keplerian, rather than Copernican astronomy. And further
confirmation of the motions is given in <i>Harmonice Mundi</i> (The
Harmony of the World, 1618) Book V, Chapter 3, where there are some
quantified references to a single planet, in addition to the main
discussion which involves the planetary system. Unfortunately, Kepler's
investigation of the motions was little appreciated by his
contemporaries, and largely ignored subsequently. However, the overall
success of his theory was confirmed in practice through the <i>Rudolphine Tables</i> (1627) - which, unlike other astronomical tables, remained observationally accurate and useful for many decades: see <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Kepler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Kepler',550,800); return false;">Kepler</a>.  These tables were calculated in terms of <img src="Keplers_laws_files/beta.gif" alt="beta">, which can now be identified as the auxiliary angle of the ellipse.  The mathematical treatment carried out in <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Kepler_planetary_motion.html">Planetary motion tackled kinematically</a>
demonstrates that this angle is the uniquely appropriate foundation for
a structure which is simple because it depends on orthogonality and
therefore is the only workable basis for Kepler's astronomy.
</p><p align="justify">
<br>
<a name="9"></a></p><h2>Section 9  <font color="blue">Essential orthogonality of the components of motion and their associated causes</font></h2>
<p align="justify">
</p><center><img src="Keplers_laws_files/Davis_fig6.gif" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 6</center>
<p align="justify">
In <i>De Caelo</i> I, 3, Aristotle had declared
that there were only two simple motions, circular and linear.
Accordingly, on this authority, Kepler was able to match each one of
the pair of results (the curve, and the independently-determined
representation of time) that he had discovered in <i>Astronomia Nova</i>,
to one of these mutually perpendicular components of motion. So this
introduces another instance of the Principle of Orthogonal Independence
(in fact dated earlier than Euclid). These components are listed in the
Summary Table at the end for reference, and illustrated in Figure (6)
by solid arrows:<br>
</p><ul>
<li><b>radial motion</b> which is measured by the linear variation in distance from the Sun;
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li><b>transradial motion</b> which is measured by the
variation in the area swept out: this motion is defined to be circular
round the Sun, and thus precisely at right angles to the radial motion.
(It is called 'transverse motion' by some mathematicians.) Indeed, had
Kepler realized that one of the motions attributed to the planet is
strictly (though instantaneously) circular, he would surely have been
pleased that the Platonic precept (see Section 3) had not been entirely
abandoned after all.<br>
</li></ul>
This pair of component motions, whose source is the Sun (see Section
3), is contrasted in Figure (6) with the single tangential velocity,
shown dashed, which, in Newton's work, superseded and replaced the
Keplerian components of motion. (We shall therefore exclude discussion
of the radically alternative approach invented by Newton around half a
century later, which was concerned with what was happening at the
perimeter of the path - something that Kepler could never have known
about, nor would have been interested in.)
<p align="justify">Neither was Kepler's approach to the problem of
causes of motion in any mathematical sense an anticipation of the work
of Newton (despite the views of some previous commentators); it was, by
contrast, governed by his background in the Aristotelian tradition.
Though this Aristotelian 'physics' was becoming outdated even in
Kepler's day, people still believed that an object would not move
unless there was a 'force' or cause of motion to make it do so. Also,
this 'force' had to act by contact; and, the object would then move
only in the direction of the 'force', while the amount of 'force' was
responsible for the amount of motion produced. Kepler could never have
supposed that the Sun could exert an attractive force because that
concept did not exist in Aristotelian terms.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="10"></a></p><h2>Section 10  <font color="blue">The Sun's rotation: the cause of transradial motion</font></h2>
<p align="justify">We will deal first with the cause of the transradial
motion because the revolution of the planets round the Sun is the most
outstanding feature of a heliocentric universe, and requires a
universal cause. Kepler accounted for that motion by inventing the
rotation of the Sun on its axis. He suggested this a few years before
the rotation was actually established, c.1610, from observations of
sunspots by Galileo, Scheiner (a minor contemporary astronomer), and
independently by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Harriot.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Harriot',550,800); return false;">Harriot</a>
(c.1560-1621). Thus, Kepler envisaged that the rays emitted by the
rotating Sun would 'hit' or impel each planet continuously round in a
circle. Naturally, he expected that this impulsion would be less when
the planet was further from the Sun, so he reasonably supposed that the
action of the rays would vary inverse-linearly (that is, weaken) with
distance. Amazingly, the formulation of this cause then exactly agrees
with the evaluation of the transradial motion set out in the Summary
Table at the end, as is confirmed by the modern treatment in <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Kepler_planetary_motion.html">Planetary motion tackled kinematically</a>.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="11"></a></p><h2>Section 11  <font color="blue">Magnetism: the cause of radial motion</font></h2>
<p align="justify">
To account for radial motion, Kepler obviously needed a cause that
would be individual to each planet, because every planetary ellipse is
a different shape. He selected magnetism, having come across a
recently-published book, <i>De Magnete</i> (On the Magnet, 1600) by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Gilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Gilbert',550,800); return false;">Gilbert</a>
(1544-1603), which stated that the Earth should be regarded as a giant
magnet. Because of his Copernican convictions, Kepler extended this
idea to suppose that every planet possessed magnetism, and contained a
set of 'fibres' fixed within its body which could be activated by the
Sun's magnetism; and he further supposed that each set of fibres
possessed a unique potential magnetic 'strength' that could be
associated with the individual eccentricity of the particular planetary
path. Unfortunately the way this cause was supposed to function cannot
be associated with action at a distance (because this was a
nonAristotelian concept). Thus it is not correct - nor is it meaningful
- to interpret Kepler's magnetism as a 'force', either in an
Aristotelean or in a modern context. The radial motion itself was
evaluated by taking a small variation (an increment) of the distance
from the Sun with respect to a small change in the auxiliary angle: see
Summary Table at the end, confirmed by the modern treatment in <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Kepler_planetary_motion.html">Planetary motion tackled kinematically</a>.  Ultimately the cause provided its own justification - because the radial motion it produced is sound in mathematical terms.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="12"></a></p><h2>Section 12  <font color="blue">The associated pair of orthogonal causes</font></h2>
<p align="justify">
Kepler was the first to introduce the concept of causation into
astronomy, and in accordance with his Copernican convictions, he
naturally believed that the Sun was the generator of all causes.
Moreover, it seemed common sense to suppose that the Sun could only act
(or activate) continuously either in a radial direction or circularly
round itself, and this consideration, for Kepler, determined the
direction of the causes available and limited their number to two. Thus
the causes (as well as the motions and the constituents of the orbit)
were also subject to the operation of the Principle of Orthogonal
Independence.
</p><p align="justify">Hence, each of the pair of perpendicular
component motions illustrated in Figure (6) can be matched to its own
distinct cause, as indicated in the Summary Table at the end, in
accordance with the Principle of Economy (another relic of Aristotle) -
one cause per motion. We summarize Kepler's final suppositions:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>The precedent cause was the action of the Sun's rays, due to its
rotation, which produced transradial motion. This constituted an
entirely acceptable Aristotelian 'force', satisfying the three
conditions listed in Section 9;
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li>The lesser cause was magnetism, generated by the Sun,
which activated the planetary fibres. The Sun appeared to function
merely as a catalyst to facilitate radial motion - on no account can it
be regarded as a Newtonian force (nor as an Aristotelian 'force').<br>
</li></ul>
With hindsight we can appreciate that Kepler would not have been able
to identify these causes satisfactorily until he had discovered the
associated motions, in his mature work. (Unfortunately Kepler's
successors have often failed to distinguish these causes clearly,
because they have only considered his early opinions in <i>Astronomia Nova</i>,
when he had not yet sorted things out.) Of course Kepler's final views
on causes were entirely wrong in modern eyes, but they were eminently
sensible: one traditional, the other making use of the most recent
knowledge of the day.
<p align="justify">
<a name="13"></a></p><h2>Section 13  <font color="blue">Conclusion: the criterion of simplicity</font></h2>
<p align="justify">Kepler was able to formulate a complete account of
planetary motion using only elementary geometry, and accordingly we
will highlight the two overriding reasons for his achievement, putting
them in a historical context. They are both new to Keplerian analysis.
</p><p align="justify">
</p><ol type="a"><li a=""><b>Kinematics (not dynamics): the one-body problem</b><br>It
was not until 1687 that Newton's Principia introduced the modern
quantifiable concept of mass. (That book also contained a sophisticated
treatment of tangential velocity in orbit, as well as formulating a
concept of acceleration to accompany the concept of attractive force.)
However, in the early part of the seventeenth century, Kepler's
thinking had already progressed beyond that of Copernicus, to realize
that a fresh formulation of time was crucial - even though he had no
reason to be aware of the dimension of mass in its application to the
solar system. Therefore, from a modern viewpoint, Kepler's work was
purely kinematical, and he was entirely correct to treat each
individual planet as if it were the only particle in the universe apart
from the fixed Sun. This is the process that was described previously
as idealization because it ensured an exact solution (of the one-body
problem) which was uniquely simple. It is interesting that an analogous
situation occurred in the work of Galileo, Kepler's contemporary, when
he idealized the motion of a projectile (as a perfect parabola) by
neglecting air resistance. The solutions reached in each case are in
some senses provisional, but they are certainly vital steps on the way
to a modern solution.
<p align="justify">
</p></li><li b=""><b>Orthogonality</b><br>There is a further analogy
with the work of Galileo, who also introduced orthogonal components of
motion for the study of projectiles. However, unlike Kepler, these
components were horizontal and vertical, but like Kepler, Galileo never
felt the need to investigate the existence of a single 'resultant'
motion, nor to attempt to determine its direction. (In all other
respects, the methods of the two were quite different.) The table below
shows the fundamentally orthogonal structure of Kepler's planetary
astronomy. Remarkably, this account forms a package which is both
coherent and complete in which the inclusion of, for example, a further
cause would have been altogether redundant. (This accounts for the
absence of any mention of gravity in Kepler's work on planetary orbits
- it is introduced only in his separate discussion of the Earth-Moon
system - while gravity would have been unacceptable to Kepler anyway
because it involves action at a distance.) <br>
