<a name="s1"></a>I [EFR] am sitting at my desk in St Andrews beginning
to write this article just after 10 am on Tuesday 8 June 2004. Why is
this such a special time? Well a very rare event is happening as I
write, namely a transit of Venus across the Sun. Sadly I am unable to
view it since the sky is covered with heavy cloud. Previous such
transits have been significant in determining the distance between the
Earth and the Sun. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a>,
in 1679, pointed out that viewing such a transit from two points on the
Earth a known distance apart could be used to determine the size of the
solar system. The transits of June 1761 and 1769 and those of December
in 1874 and 1882 were used to obtain an accurate value for the
astronomical unit, which is the distance from the Earth to the Sun. We
shall return to this event later in the article, but we should begin
with the earliest attempts to measure the size of the universe.
</p><p align="justify">Perhaps the first thing to mention is that the
concept of the "universe" has changed over time. In the earliest times
the universe was considered to consist of the Earth with the Moon, Sun,
and planets revolving round it. The outer limit of this universe was
the sphere of the fixed stars. Even before historical records began it
was realised that the Moon was closer to the Earth than the Sun, the
planets, and the stars, since it was seen to move in front of them.
Although no means to estimate distances to these bodies was available,
it was taken as "obvious" that the objects closer to the Earth would
return to the same position relative to the fixed stars more quickly
than the more distant objects. Knowing that the Moon took 27 days,
Mercury 88 days, Venus 225 days, Mars 2 years, Jupiter 12 years, and
Saturn 29 years, this was taken as a measure of their distances from
Earth.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s5"></a>The first person that we know to have obtained values for the distances of the Sun and Moon was <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a> in the 3rd century BC. See our biography of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a>
for details of his method. The way he determined the distances was
theoretically correct, although he had problems measuring of small
angles accurate and also with knowing the moment when the Moon was
exactly half illuminated. These difficulties led to considerable
errors. He estimated the diameter of the Moon by observing the shape of
the shadow of the Earth on it during an eclipse.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s7"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hipparchus',550,800); return false;">Hipparchus</a> in the 2nd century BC used the same methods as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristarchus',550,800); return false;">Aristarchus</a>
but with improved accuracy. He estimated that the distance from the
Earth to the Moon is 59 times the radius of the Earth and the distance
to the Sun is 1,200 times the radius of the Earth, a serious
underestimate. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a>,
in the 2nd century AD, calculated the distance to the Moon using a
parallax method. Observing the position of the Moon against the fixed
stars from two points on the Earth a known distance apart at the same
time led him to obtain the same result as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hipparchus',550,800); return false;">Hipparchus</a>, namely that he distance from the Earth to the Moon was 59 times the radius of the Earth. Using the same method as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hipparchus',550,800); return false;">Hipparchus</a> to determine the distance to the Sun led <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a> to the same serious underestimate in its distance. No further progress occurred until <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Copernicus',550,800); return false;">Copernicus</a> in the 16th century.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s9"></a>In fact <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Copernicus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Copernicus',550,800); return false;">Copernicus</a>, although proposing a very different model of the universe from <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a>,
took essentially the same values for the distances to the Sun and Moon.
He did improve the value for the distance to the Sun to 1,500 times the
radius of the Earth but this is still such a serious underestimate that
it is little improvement. In February 1632 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a> published <i>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World - Ptolemaic and Copernican.</i>
It takes the form of a dialogue between Salviati, who argues for the
Copernican system, and Simplicio who is an Aristotelian philosopher. An
argument against the Earth rotating about the Sun had been that in this
case the closer stars should appear to move backwards and forwards
relative to the distant stars due to the observer moving through the
diameter of the Earth's orbit every six months. For this not to be
observed meant that the stars must be very distant indeed. But most
claimed that the stars were not points of light but actually small
disks, so must be extremely large. Salviati counters these arguments by
claiming (correctly) that the stars are only points of light and the
appearance of a disk is an illusion. If <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Galileo.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Galileo',550,800); return false;">Galileo</a> was correct, however, the argument did show that the universe was huge and the distances to the stars was immense.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s11"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Kepler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Kepler',550,800); return false;">Kepler</a>'s
Third Law, published in 1619, made the relative distances within the
solar system known, but until one distance was known accurately the
size was still unknown. However, he made an important observation
regarding the distance to the Sun. If, he argued, the distance to the
Sun was 1,2000 times the radius of the Earth then Mars, at its closest
approach to the Earth, should be closer than this distance. This meant
that Mars should exhibit a parallax which was well within the accuracy
of his observations. However, he did not observe any parallax so
deduced that the accepted distance to the Sun was an underestimate.
Having no data on which to base a more accurate estimate he resorted to
his ideas of harmony. However, all that was now needed, as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Kepler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Kepler',550,800); return false;">Kepler</a> had pointed out, was an accurate measurement of the distance to Mars and the scale was fixed.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s13"></a>In 1671 the French planned an expedition, one aim of
which was to find an accurate distance to Mars. The expedition was to
go to Cayenne and observations of Mars made from there and from Paris
would provide an accurate value for its distance. The time was chosen
to coincide with the closest approach of Mars to the Earth to maximise
the accuracy of the observations. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Richer.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Richer',550,800); return false;">Richer</a> made the observations from Cayenne and, after his return to Paris, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Cassini.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Cassini',550,800); return false;">Cassini</a>
reduced the data obtained to give the distance from the Earth to the
Sun to be 87 million miles. One could argue that this is still
relatively far from the true value of 93 million miles, but it was a
vast improvement over <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Ptolemy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ptolemy',550,800); return false;">Ptolemy</a>'s value which was of the order of 4 million miles.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s15"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a>,
in 1718, noted that three stars, Sirius, Procyon and Arcturus, had
moved relative to the ecliptic (the apparent line of the Sun through
the stars) since <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hipparchus',550,800); return false;">Hipparchus</a> had measured their positions. Sirius had even moved from the position given by Tycho <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Brache.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Brache',550,800); return false;">Brache</a>. Certainly it was not due to the ecliptic moving as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a> determined from the positions of other stars. Of course <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a> had no means of knowing whether this was due to observational errors by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hipparchus.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hipparchus',550,800); return false;">Hipparchus</a>,
but he was confident enough in the ancient data to state clearly that
he believed that it was due to these stars moving their actual
positions, called the proper motion of a star. Many attempts to measure
the parallax of a star were made, but none were successful. Bradley, in
1728, did discover the aberration of light while trying to determine a
stellar parallax.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s17"></a>As we mentioned at the beginning of this article, the
use of a transit of Venus to obtain an accurate value for the distance
to the Sun had been suggested by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Halley.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Halley',550,800); return false;">Halley</a>.
There was considerable interest in using the transits of June 1761 and
June 1769 for this purpose and many astronomers set out to observe them
from a variety of places such as St Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and
India. Although the method was sound, there was great difficulty in
determining the exact moment of contact of the disk of the Sun and the
disk of Venus. As a result estimates of the distance to the Sun varied
by up to 10 million miles. </p><p align="justify">
William Herschel believed that the brightness of a star could be taken
as a measure of its distance. He studied nebulas, some of which had
been catalogued by Charles Messier, which could not be resolved into
stars. At first he thought these were new "island universes" - star
systems like the Milky Way but far more distant. However when he
studied large numbers of these he discovered that their distribution
was connected to the plane of the Milky Way, so this seemed to prove
that these were not "island universes" but rather star clusters in the
Milky Way which could not be resolved into stars. Further evidence for
this latter theory occurred when more powerful telescopes were able to
resolve some into stars. However, Herschel seems to have continued to
believe that some of the nebulas that he was observing were indeed
island universes. He was right!
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s21"></a>The first person to measure a stellar parallax was <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Bessel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Bessel',550,800); return false;">Bessel</a>.
He determined the distance to 61 Cygni, announcing his result in 1838.
Clearly to succeed it was important to choose a star which was close to
the Sun. His method for selecting such a star was based on selecting
one which had the greatest proper motion of all the stars he had
studied. He correctly deduced that this would mean that the star was
close. Since 61 Cygni is a relatively dim star it was a bold choice
based on his correct understanding of the cause of the proper motions. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Bessel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Bessel',550,800); return false;">Bessel</a>,
using a Fraunhofer heliometer to make the measurements, announced his
value of 0.314" which, given the diameter of the Earth's orbit, gave a
distance of about 10 light years. The correct value of the parallax of
61 Cygni is 0.292". Although there had been many years of failed
attempts to measure a stellar parallax, once <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Bessel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Bessel',550,800); return false;">Bessel</a>
made his announcement distances to several others were measured. Thomas
Henderson measured the parallax of Alpha Centuari in 1839, showing it
had a parallax around three times greater that 61 Cygni, so was much
closer. Henderson had indeed measured the distance to the nearest star.
Over the next years the distances to many other stars were found using
the parallax method but it was a method which would never be able to
find distances to any but the closest stars.
</p><p align="justify">A major advance in calculating distances came
about in 1908 when Henrietta Swan Leavitt observed variable stars in
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. These are two small companion
galaxies of the Milky Way and since the distance to these small
galaxies is much greater than their diameters, all the stars in them
are approximately the same distance away. Leavitt observed that there
was a relationship between the period of variability of the stars she
was studying, namely stars called Cepheids, and their absolute
brightness. By 1912 this had been refined so that it was a reliable
measure of the distance of a Cepheid variable star, for one only needed
to determine the period, which is the time between two occurrences of
maximum brightness, to obtain a value for the absolute brightness of
the star. Once the absolute brightness of a star is known, then it is
easy to determine its distance by measuring its apparent brightness.
</p><p align="justify">Harlow Shapley, working at the Mount Wilson
Observatory in the United States, began to try to work out the shape
and size of the Milky Way using Cepheids as a measure of distance. By
1919 he had worked out that it was a disk which had a huge bulge at the
centre. The Sun, he estimated, was situated at about <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>
of the distance from the centre to the outer edge of the galaxy. In
this he was absolutely correct, but in his estimate of the size of the
Milky Way galaxy he overestimated by a factor of about 3 (it is
actually about 100,000 light years in diameter). This came about since
distant stars are faint not only because of their distance, but also
because their light has had to pass through dust and gas on its
journey. Failing to take this into account meant that Shapley thought
that distant stars were further away than they actually were. However,
at this stage Shapley and other astronomers thought that at last we had
an accurate estimate for the size of the universe which, despite
William Herschel's belief in island universes beyond the Milky Way, was
thought to consist of only the Milky Way galaxy and some small
companion galaxies such as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s27"></a>In 1920 there was a debate between Shapley and Heber
Curtis on the distance scale of the universe and on the spiral nebulas.
Shapley was totally committed to the view that the Milky Way was
essentially the whole universe and that the spiral nebulas were local
to that system. Vesto Slipher, who had worked at the Lowell Observatory
with the 24-inch telescope there since 1901, had been asked to
investigate the spiral nebulas by Percival Lowell. By 1912 Slipher had
made a major breakthrough when he had obtained a spectrograph of the
Andromeda Nebula and found its light shifted towards the blue. This, he
realised, was as a result of the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Doppler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Doppler',550,800); return false;">Doppler</a>
effect, and meant that the Andromeda Nebula was approaching at 300 km
per second. This was at the time the greatest velocity measured for an
astronomical object. Slipher continued his work and by 1914 had
obtained spectrographs of 15 spiral nebulas. Of these 13 exhibited
redshifts, so were receding, and he discovered that two were receding
at over 1000 km per second. In a paper of 1917 he wrote:
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>It has for a long time been suggested that the spiral nebulae are
stellar systems seen at great distances. This is the so-called "island
universe" theory, which regards our stellar system and the Milky Way as
a great spiral nebula which we see from within.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
Another person who believed that they had discovered another galaxy
comparable to the Milky Way was Milton Humason. He was employed as a
janitor at the Mount Wilson observatory but had been taught to operate
the telescopes. In the winter of 1920-21 Shapley had asked him to take
photographs of the Andromeda Nebula with the 100-inch telescope at
Mount Wilson which had been in operation for about 2 years. Humason
thought that the photographs had just resolved the Andromeda Nebula
into individual stars but when he pointed this out to Shapley he was
told not to be silly! Shapley had staked his reputation on the belief
that the Milky Way comprised the whole universe and he wasn't going to
change his mind because of evidence coming from a former janitor who
had just been promoted onto the scientific staff.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s31"></a>The first observations of the Andromeda Nebula which led to its distance being calculated were made in 1923 by <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Edwin Hubble</a>,
also using the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson. He hoped to show
that it was a star system outside the Milky Way and took photographs to
see if he might be lucky and spot a nova, a star which dramatically
brightens then slowly fades back to its original brightness. In October
1923 he did identify three objects which he thought were novas, but he
checked older photographs taken by Humason and realised that one of
these wasn't a nova but rather it was a Cepheid variable star. He was
now in a position to actively search for further Cepheid variables in
the Andromeda Nebula and found several others, and identified Cepheid
variables in a number of other spiral nebulas too. He reported his
findings to the January meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
He estimated that the Andromeda Nebula was one million light years away
(about 10<sup>19</sup> km). Actually it is about twice that distance.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s33"></a>Now that he knew that the spiral nebulas were external galaxies, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>
was able to see from Slipher's results on the redshifts of the spiral
nebulas that most were receding and, it looked as though those further
away were receding more rapidly. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>
then asked Humason to use the 100-inch at Mount Wilson to find more
spectrographs of spiral galaxies than had been within range of Slipher
with his 24-inch telescope. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> himself tried to use a variety of techniques to estimate the distances of these galaxies. In 1919 <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>
announced that there was a linear relation between the distance to a
spiral galaxy and its speed of recession. In a paper written jointly by
<a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>
and Humason in 1931 they gave data for more spiral galaxies and
estimated the constant in the linear relation to be 558. Now to measure
distance to a distant galaxy one only had to find its redshift and use <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>'s Law to find its distance.
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s35"></a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eddington.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eddington',550,800); return false;">Eddington</a> soon pointed out what he considered a flaw in <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>'s
theory. We now knew the distances to galaxies, could measure their
brightness, so could find their size. It turned out that the two
largest galaxies in the whole universe seemed to be the Milky Way and
the Andromeda galaxy. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eddington.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eddington',550,800); return false;">Eddington</a> wrote in 1933:-
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">
<i>Frankly I do not believe it; it would be too much of a coincidence.
I think that ... ultimately we shall find that there are many galaxies
of a size equal to and surpassing our own.</i>
</p></blockquote><p align="justify">
<a name="s39"></a>One could of course play the game the other way round and ask what value of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>'s
constant had to be so that distant galaxies were comparable in size to
the Milky Way. The answer came out to somewhere between 55 and 60 so it
this argument was right then <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>'s
measurements gave a constant 10 times too large. There was a second
problem. If one asked what had happened in the past then at one time
all the galaxies must have been very close together. This fitted with
the big bang theory of the creation of the universe but taking <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>'s constant as 558 gave an age for the universe which was less than the ages of the oldest rocks on Earth. How could this be?
</p><p align="justify">
<a name="s41"></a>Walter Baade made observations with the 100-inch
telescope in 1944 which led to the discovery that there were two type
of stars, Population I and Population II stars. Moreover there were two
different types of Cepheid variables, one for each Population. In 1948
the 200-inch telescope at Mount Palomar became operational and more
data could be obtained. By 1952 Baade could announce that the distance
scale was wrong by a factor of 2, the Andromeda galaxy was twice as far
away as <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> had estimated, and the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> constant was about 250. He had measured the distance to the Andromeda galaxy pretty accurately but his value for the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> constant still left it open to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Eddington.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Eddington',550,800); return false;">Eddington</a>'s objection.

<a name="s43"></a>It was Allan Sandage, who was just completing his
doctorate in 1952, who carried on refining the distance scale using the
200-inch telescope. He found many errors in the earlier work which had
led to incorrect results. In 1956, in a joint paper with Humason and
Nick Mayall, he gave 180 as his estimate of the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> constant. This meant that the universe was, by Sandage's calculations, three times bigger than <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a>
had believed in the sense that distances to distant galaxies were three
times their previous value. By the early 1960s Sandage was claiming
that his best estimate for the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> constant was 75. Most didn't accept this value at the time but data from the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> space telescope in the 1990s has confirmed that the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> constant is between 65 and 77. Distances are nearly ten times greater than <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Hubble.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hubble',550,800); return false;">Hubble</a> had calculated.
